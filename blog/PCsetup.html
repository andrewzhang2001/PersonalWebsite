											<h1> PC Setup: How Frugal Should We Really Be?
											</h1>
											<p>Andrew Zhang</p>
										</header>
										<p>We spend a lot of time at our computers in our daily lives whether you realize it or not.
											Whether you use it for gaming, doing homework, making calls over Zoom, or any of the infinite
											uses for a computer, it's such an integral part of our life, It's so easy for us to look at the
											cheapest options available on Amazon or a Chinese vendor, but we should also consider venturing
											into the higher price ranges depending on additional features we're willing to pay for. In this article
											I'll be exploring some of the tech purchases I have made and my reasoning behind it.

												<h3>Longevity/Durability</h3>
												<p>When you buy cheap options on Amazon, you might come by a lot of reviews which said this product
													wasn't able to function after a couple months. Now, you have to shell more money into buying a replacement
													when you thought you could get away with spending so little money. Buying high quality products won't have this issue.

												<h3>Comfort</h3>
												<p>Consider an item like your keyboard. You use this everyday. If you don't like a traditional keyboard for whatever reason
													you have two main options: either you continue living with this discomfort or look to invest money to improve your quality of life.
													You spend considerable money treating yourself with higher quality food, modern electronics, and other conveniences.

												<h3>Joining the Hype Train</h3>
												<p>I'm not saying you should never buy the newest pair of shoes or the very latest in tech. For example, just because
													many streamers own a Blue Yeti microphone, it doesn't mean it's the best choice for you. In my case, I shied away from
													this microphone because there is lots of background noise and I thought a dynamic microphone would better suit my circumstances.
													Do your research and pick find qualities you really want in the items. Do you really need the RGB lighting, or would you prefer
													to spend that money on a getter sounding keyboard.

												<h3>Too pricy</h3>
												<p>Just because I'm advocate for quality, it doesn't mean I shuold say you should drop $700 on the best microphone setup.
													Paying more money usually equates to better quality, but there really is diminishing returns for the casual user after a certain point.
													There is a mid-range price point where you can get really high-quality stuff for a fraction of the cost. Just do your research!

											<h3>Keyboard: E-Element Z88</h3>
											<p>
												This was my first dip into mechanical keyboards. One of the reasons why I wanted to make the switch was because
												of the smaller layouts more widely available; I don't tend to use the number pad a whole lot so something like the
												75% layout would better suit me. I came across this keyboard which, at around $40, really wasn't much more expensive than a typical
												membrane keyboard. Also, I thought I would enjoy the RGB lighting. That paired with the crisper typing experience
												made it an easy choice at the time to push the buy button for this keyboard. Considering the cost, it was a great choie
												to get my feet wet in the mechanical keyboard world.

											<h3>Mouse: Razer Mamba Wireless</h3>
											<p>This was the first mouse I got that wasn't for free from my dad's office. All the old ones had broken down, so I thought it was time
												I took matters into my own hands and buy a mouse myself. I don't require intense flicks or anything of the sort in FPS games, but I did
												want a trusted mouse with wireless capabilities. Also, I wanted a larger frame since the previous one was too small and my hands could
												not ever get a comfortable grip. I found this mouse that didn't require batteries, was wireless, had two useful macro buttons, and
												overall just looked really nice. Being around the $50 mark, I paid an extra bit of money for a whole lot of useful features.

											<h3>Mic: Shure SM58</h3>
											<p>
												I wanted to begin streaming so that led me to looking into standalone microphones -- while the headset is convenient for calling friends while gaming,
												if I wanted to make high quality audio, I would really have to look into standalone microphones. Fortunately, I found this one, which had a whole lot of
												things going for it. It's a dynamic microphone, meaning it is a lot better than the other type of microphones (condenser) at rejecting background.
												Also, this is THE stage-performing microphone, meaning it's trusted not only for it's high quality sound, but also an essentially lifetime durability through any abuse.
												Given this and the fact that I could see myself requiring a good standalone microphone in the future, for a total set-up of about $200, I thought this was well worth the investment.
